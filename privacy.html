    <p>Ever since the creation of the internet, which happened just over 40 years ago, we have
    become numb to privacy invasion. Today, privacy invasion happens everywhere all the time, and
    in the United States, we seem to have accepted it. While there have been movements to better
    regulate how information about us is used, they have been unbearably and woefully slow, so slow
    that we are already facing a whole new tech craze: AI.</p>
    <h2>The Internet — Where Trusting in Our Surveillance Is the New Norm</h2>
    <p>
        We have the ability to communicate to anyone in the world, save information about our
        everyday lives, and entertain ourselves through computers, especially including our phones.
        What we have not truly realized is how much we give up for all of this.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are mostly familiar with the information we share voluntarily... contact information like
        phone numbers and email addresses, websites we navigate to through
        <a href="https://apnews.com/article/google-privacy-chrome-cookies-browser-bffdd0ca0af9ba7a94e95c2c7a11e4d2" target="_blank">
            internet cookies</a>, and purchases we make online. However,
        <a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2023/09/07/argument-digital-privacy" target="_blank">what we may not think about</a>
        is, for example,
        how our location is tracked. It is usually done for the sake of improving user experience,
        and while that may or may not be true, our location can reveal a lot more about us than we
        think. They can know about health issues you may be facing based on what doctor’s office
        you go to.
        <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/politics/bill-protecting-location-data-related-to-reproductive-and-gender-affirming-care-clears-mass-house-159-0/3423203/" target="_blank">
            They can know about your gender identity and sexual orientation.
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>
        The infamous ad industry creates consumer profiles for targeted advertising, and there is
        little to no transparency on what they do with people’s data. Enforcing the limited
        regulations that protect consumer data is incredibly difficult, since the line drawn to
        which private information can be shared is ambiguous. We have to rely on several sector-specific
        laws (for example, HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), rather
        than one all-encompassing privacy law. U.S. federal law has always been behind tech
        development, and privacy is one of the scariest issues of today, considering the public
        does not know what goes on behind the scenes of data use.
    </p>
    <h2>AI — Prioritizing Efficiency Over Humanity</h2>
    <p>
        Our excitement for ChatGPT’s ability to improve our efficiency has overshadowed its very
        many flaws. While there are many, privacy is one that lacks attention. It almost feels like
        we are okay with becoming robots, with no mind or soul, if it means doing more in less time.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/italy-ban-chatgpt-privacy-gdpr/" target="_blank">
            The app was temporarily banned in Italy in March 2023</a>, and the European Union generally has
        stronger privacy protection laws than other countries. The EU’s General Data Protection
        Regulation (GDPR) is a more unified approach to privacy protection law compared to the
        aforementioned fragmented laws in the U.S.
    </p>
    <p>
        Further concerns arise when considering ChatGPT’s development to further access the user’s
        screen, camera, and apps. In particular,
        <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-and-apple-announce-partnership/" target="_blank">
            Apple and ChatGPT announced a partnership</a> last year
        to integrate ChatGPT into Apple products. Giving ChatGPT the capability to access
        Apple features could greatly compromise privacy,
        <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2024/05/17/chatgpt-4o-is-wildly-capable-but-it-could-be-a-privacy-nightmare/" target="_blank">
            especially considering the U.S.’s less stringent laws compared to the GDPR</a>.
    </p>
    <p>ChatGPT can answer questions a little too well. In one instance, when someone gave a
        question about a specific project that I have worked on at Northeastern, ChatGPT was able to
        give a thorough response with all the details about the project. What my project
        collaborators and I realized is that it actually took all those details from my portfolio
        (a website I created using GitHub for job applications). While it was nice to figure out
        how AI could have possibly gotten this information, it is scary that it was able to find
        this information in the first place. In addition, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/22/technology/openai-chatgpt-privacy-exploit.html" target="_blank">
            people have found ways to bypass protections meant to prevent AI from answering
            questions that ask for people’s personal information</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/deepseek-ai-china-privacy-data/" target="_blank">
            While DeepSeek is causing a panic in the AI industry, it has raised privacy concerns due to
        its data storage in China and potential government access under Chinese laws.</a> It directly
        clashes with the GDPR as there may be a lack of transparency for these practices and data
        sharing with Chinese companies. This is not far from the criticism ChatGPT has faced, and
        similar to Italy’s temporary ban of ChatGPT, the same is likely to happen in South Korea,
        <a href="https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-deepseek-app-downloads-privacy-concerns-ai-20950f357276b9bb8f2a70a4b3c03e96" target="_blank">
            where downloads of DeepSeek have been paused until privacy protections are strengthened</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is scary to think what could happen if we do not keep AI in check, as privacy is one of
        our most important human rights. Today, we must be aware of these issues as we move forward
        in the world and not let technology consume our humanity.
